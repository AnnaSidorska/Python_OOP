Thanks for your letter. It was nice to hear from you. I'm sorry to hear about your problem. Your brother is in a trap. Nevertheless, I would like to advice you some things.
I think the first thing you can do is to involve your family to help your brother. Your mom and dad probably have more influence on your brother than you do. If you group with them, you are likely to help him with his obsession. They say, "Union is strength"?
